* About:-
A 3-Axis CNC engraving machine is a computer-controlled device capable of performing three-dimensional engraving, carving, and cutting tasks with remarkable precision.
We created a low-cost CNC engraving machine using an Arduino Uno as the controller for the CNC machine. 
The code used for Arduino uno is an open-source code called GRBL.
To control the CNC engraving machine we used software called Universal G-Code Sender(UGS).

* Material Used to build CNC machine:-
  Arduino Uno R3,
  CNC Shield V3,
  3 Nema-17 Stepper motors,
  A spindel motor RS775 (15000rpm),
  3 A4988 Stepper motor driver,
  24v 5A Power Supply,
  ball bearings,
  3 Lead screws,
  stepper motor couplers,
  linear bearings,
  Motor holders,
  ER-11 Chuck(if not available use drill chuck)
  Wood for the frame of CNC.
